## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_xlsx("./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
            sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
            range = cell_cols("A:N")
            ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls=round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

Read precipitation data

``` r
precip_2018=
  read_xlsx("./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
            sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
            skip =1
            ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year=2018) %>% 
  select(year,everything())

precip_2017=
  read_xlsx("./Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
            sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
            skip =1
            ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year=2017) %>% 
  select(year,everything())
```

Combine annual precipitation

``` r
month_df = tibble(
  month_num = 1:12,
  month_name = month.name
)

precip_df=
  bind_rows(precip_2018,precip_2017)

precip_df = left_join(precip_df,month_df,by = c("month" = "month_num"))
```

Dataset **“trashwheel\_df”** contains the information of statistics of
each dumpter with the year range of 2014, 2019. There are totally 344 of
observations. It also contains the weight, volume as well as the number
and type of trash collected. Dataset **“precip\_data”** contains the
information of total precipitation in each month with the year range of
2017, 2018. There are totally 24 observations.

Total precipitation in 2018 is 70.33(in).

The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 is 8.

## Problem 2

Read & clean data

``` r
subway = read_csv("./NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",col_types = '-ccnnccccccccccccf-f--l---------') %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(ADA_compliance=ada)
  mutate (subway, entry=as.logical(ifelse(pull(subway, entry)=="YES",1, 0))) 
```

This data contains information and statistics of NYC subway. It includes
the line & stations name and routes served as well as other features
such as ADA compliance. In this datasets, the dimension is 1868\*19. The
file was imported with specified variable type assigned with function
“col\_types”. Then the column name was cleaned with “clean\_names()”.
Column name “ada” was renamed into “ADA\_compliance” for clarification.
Lastly, variable “entry” was changed to logical variable.

**How many distinct stations are there?**

There are 465 distinct stations

**How many stations are ADA compliant**

There are 84 stations that are ADA compliant.

**What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance?**

37.704918 % of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance.

Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct variable

``` r
subway_distinct = pivot_longer(subway,
               route1:route11,
               names_to = "route_name",
               names_prefix = "route",
               values_to = "route_number"
               ) %>% 
  drop_na(route_number)
```

**How many distinct stations serve the A train?**

reformat the dataset so that only distinct subway stations are kept

``` r
subway_distinct = distinct(subway_distinct, line, station_name, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

60 distinct stations serve the A train

**Of the stations that serve the A train, how many are ADA compliant?**

Among stations that serve the A train, 17 are ADA compliant.

## Problem 3

Clean the pols-month data

``` r
pols_df = read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon,into = c("year","month","day"),remove = TRUE,convert = TRUE)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
pols_df = left_join(pols_df,month_df,by = c("month" = "month_num")) %>% 
  select(-c(month,day)) %>% 
  select(year, month = month_name,everything()) %>% 
  mutate (
    president = case_when(
      prez_dem == 1 ~"dem",
      prez_gop == 1 ~ "gop"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(-c(prez_dem,prez_gop))
```

Clean the snp.csv data

``` r
snp_df = read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()%>% 
  separate(date,into = c("month","day","year"),remove = TRUE,convert = TRUE)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

``` r
snp_df = left_join(snp_df,month_df,by = c("month" = "month_num")) %>% 
  select(-c(month,day)) %>% 
  select(year, month = month_name,everything()) %>% 
  arrange(year,month)
```

Clean the unemployment data

``` r
unemployment_df = read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()%>% 
rename(January=jan, February=feb,March=mar,April=apr,May=may,June=jun,July=jul,August=aug,September=sep,October=oct,November=nov,December=dec) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    January:December,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment"
  )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

Merge the datasets

``` r
combined_df = left_join(pols_df,snp_df,by = c("year","month")) %>% 
  left_join(unemployment_df,by = c("year","month"))
```

The dataset **“pols\_df”** contains information of national politicians
who are democratic or republican. The key variables include whether
president was democratic or republican at a given time, as well as
number of governers, senators and representativs from the two parties.
The dimension of pols dataset is 822\*9. The year range is \[1947,
2015\].

The dataset **“snp\_df”** contains the information of the closing value
Standard & Poor’s stock market index (S\&P) at a given time. The
specific date was dropped but year and month were kept to merge with
other datasets.The dimension of dataset is 787\*3. The year range is
\[1950, 2015\].

The dataset **“unemployment\_df”** contains the perceptage of
unemployment in a given month and year. The dimension of dataset is
816\*3. The year range is \[1948, 2015\].

The **combined dataset** merged from pols\_df, snp\_df and
unemployment\_df provide information on politicians at a given time, and
economic performance (represented by S\&P) and unemployment at that
time. The dimension of the resulting data is 822\*11. The year range is
\[1947, 2015\]. The politician affiliation of the president was
represented by variable “president”. The S\&P value was represented by
variable “closing” and the unemployment rate was represented by variable
“unemployment”.
